When I described my misgivings to you about the purported benefit of PR you expressed some discomfort regarding the prospect of broaching that subject with Balaji should experiments show Clockwork's PR assumptions to be false. You wondered out loud how you might delicately handle communicating that information and what the next steps would be.

I will note that at this point this position has been delegated to me, before I have had a chance to complete my experiments. As you well know I am not at all shy so this is not a problem for me. I mention it so you have a sense of the current situation between Balaji and myself.
